Bite 2. Regex Fun

Learn Python regular expressions by writing the following 3 functions.

In each function's docstring we show the expected result.

The tests verify these expected results when you hit Save + Verify. We will do a more ample regex bite later on.

Note that for parsing HTML you would use a library of some sort, this is just to train your regex skills.
